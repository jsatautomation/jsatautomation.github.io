A pharmaceutical client had an over-engineered process control system that was developed more than a decade ago and frequently re-configured without standard design practices. Many crucial components of the configuration were not class-based, and a majority of the configuration was not S88 compliant. Online user interventions were performed daily to alleviate configuration-based process holds and failures. Production optimization initiatives that required configuration changes were delayed or avoided due to challenge and risk inherent to modifying the system.

JSat Automation developed a detailed work breakdown with the customer, identifying affected documentation and configuration elements per functional system. JSat developed a plan for efficient configuration development, documentation, and testing to facilitiate implementation during the site shutdown period.

## Challenges

During configuration development, the site shutdown window for installation testing was reduced from three weeks to three days. Project scope had to be drastically reduced to mitigate impact on production targets. JSat advised the customer on which functional system to standardize to optimize the development and testing time available. Functional systems newly excluded from the project scope were thoroughly documented in their current state to facilitate future standardization projects.

## Results

The project was completed with the new, reduced scope. Even with a single functional area affected, significant process optimization and capacity increase resulted for the entire facility. Insignificant and nuisance alarms were greatly reduced, which reduced process failures; improved yield; and reduced operational cost in terms of investigations, quality checks, regulatory reports and batch documentation. Product loss was also significantly reduced was due to optimized process operation and reduced user intervention.
