JSat Automation provided in-person customized training sessions for the engineering team of the Chinese branch of a partner automation integrator. The training focused on applying Rockwell Batch software to the human blood plasma fractionation and purification process. JSat also created and presented a training for our shared biotechnology customer also located in China. All presentations were tailored to the audience's individual skillset/needs and were structured around control system best practices and the specific process application.
